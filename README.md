# Restaurant Finder App

Used [Open Table's Public API](https://opentable.herokuapp.com/) to develop a React application that allows users to filter by City, and then refine their search results.

## Technical Questions 

### How long did you spend on the coding assignment? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

I spent approximately 18 hours working on this coding assignment. During the creation of this project, I really wanted to emphasize my understanding of React, writing accessible code, and CSS abilties. 

If I had more time to work on this project, I definitely would have dedicated more time towards learning Redux (in order to manage the state of my application in an efficient manner), and also utilize either Jest/React Testing Library to test my code.

**Features I Would Love to Add:**
- Pagination (to better organize the restaurant cards) 
- A Modal View (where users would be able to read more details about a specific restaurant) 
- Return an error message if no cities are found
